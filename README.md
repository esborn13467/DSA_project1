# Student Email Generation and Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project involves processing a list of student names to generate unique email addresses, separate students by gender, identify names with special characters, calculate name similarities using LaBSE, and shuffle the list of names. The results are saved in various formats (CSV, TSV, JSON, JSONL) and uploaded to Google Drive.
